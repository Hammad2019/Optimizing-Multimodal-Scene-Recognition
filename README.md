Multimodal Scene Recognition with Feature Selection

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for multimodal scene recognition using deep learning. The scripts include loading and preprocessing data, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, training the network, and selecting features based on mutual information.

    scene_recognition.m: Main MATLAB script for data loading, preprocessing, model training, feature selection, and fine-tuning.
    SceneRecognition.mat: Trained network saved after fine-tuning (generated by running scene_recognition.m).

Prerequisites

    MATLAB (a product of The MathWorks, Inc.)
    Deep Learning Toolbox
    Image Processing Toolbox

Usage
Scene Recognition Script

The scene_recognition.m script performs the following tasks:

    Load and Split Data:
        Loads images from the specified directory.
        Splits the data into training and test sets.

    Data Augmentation:
        Resizes the images for consistency.

    Build Network Architecture:
        Constructs a CNN using various convolutional, pooling, ReLU, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.

    Train the Network:
        Trains the network using the specified training options.

    Feature Selection:
        Extracts features from a fully connected layer.
        Calculates mutual information to select the top features.

    Fine-Tuning:
        Fine-tunes the network using the selected features.

    Evaluate the Network:
        Classifies the test set and displays the confusion matrix.
        Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model.
